# Form-validation
I developed a form validation feature that checks user inputs for accuracy. It validates fields like name, email, phone number, and message, ensuring no fields are left empty, the email is in a proper format, and the phone number is correctly formatted. Instant feedback is provided to enhance the user experience.
